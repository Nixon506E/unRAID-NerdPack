BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.

The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
for daily backups since only changes are stored. The authenticated
encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted
targets.

Borg is a fork of Attic and is maintained by "The Borg collective".

Optional dependencies:
- llfuse (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/llfuse/) is required,
  if you wish to mount an archive as a FUSE filesystem,
- Sphinx (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/Sphinx/) and
  sphinx_rtd_theme (https://slackbuilds.org/apps/sphinx_rtd_theme/)
  are required if you wish to build the docs (man, html).
  Please note that the build will fail if Sphinx is installed,
  but sphinx_rtd_theme is not.
